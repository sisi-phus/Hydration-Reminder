# Hydration-Reminder

I'm not very good with keeping track of my daily water intake, so I decided to start this project with the goal of having a working reminder for me. 

How it will work:

Press "Start" button to start a timer, when the timer runs out, the application will remind you to drink something.

The length of the timer is determined by the time you start the program, with 6am system time giving you a 2h timer. 
from 12pm onwards the timer will remain at 30 Minutes length.

When the timer reaches zero, the window will pop up, and start a 5 minute timer, at which's end you computer will be shut down.
